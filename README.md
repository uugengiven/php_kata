# PHP Kata

This is a practice kata to type in to get some PHP commands and usage into your fingers.

## Usage

This kata uses a devcontainer to function. It is built with the built in VSCode devcontainer extention using `php:1-8.2-bullseye` as the base.

Start by typing in the branch `day_1` and then when complete, switch to branch `day_2` and add those changes.

On day one, to test your code, run `php demo.php` from the VSCode terminal.

On day two, test your code by going to `localhost:8080` in a browser.
