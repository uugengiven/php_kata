Today at school was {{adjective}}! First, I forgot my {{school supply}} in my {{place}}. During {{subject}} class, the teacher asked me to {{verb}} in front of everyone. At lunch, I accidentally spilled {{liquid}} all over {{person's name}}. In gym class, we had to {{verb}} around the {{place}} {{number}} times. The worst part was when I {{past tense verb}} and everyone saw my {{adjective}} {{clothing item}}!
